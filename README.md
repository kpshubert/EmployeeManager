This project is a demonstration project "commissioned by" Intileblue for a "skills demonstration exercise."
It is very basic.
I would typically do more on this were I tasked to actually write such an application.
Among other things, I would add some sort of authentication.
Keep in mind this application uses a localdb database called dEmployeManager, containing two tables tEM_Employee, and tEM_Department.
